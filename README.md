# MolecularSpectraGenerator
Useful tool for molecular spectra generation. Can be used to to simulate particular rotational lines in various experimental conditions. </br>
Used packages: NumPy, SciPy, MatplotLib (for data manipulation and visualization) and Tkinter (for user-friendly GUI)</br>
All levels are presented in inverse cm. </br>
G - transition energy (vibrational/electronic transition)</br>
B - rotational constant</br>
D - centrifugal stretching constant</br>
H, L - 2nd and 3rd centrifugal streching correction terms</br>
P, Q, R  branches - should be chosen appropriately depending of the molecule</br>
Delta - resolution</br>
ppFWHM - points per Full Width half maximum</br>
The last generated spectra is saved after closing the plot!
